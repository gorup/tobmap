# As of this commit, I spent 90 mins initially on the schema just thinking, but all of the other code has taken I'd say 3-4 hours. Visualization, graph generation, snap API skeleton. What's left is snap graph creation, snap search API impl, then graph search API impl, then maybe a UI but for now probably just render lines for a google maps URL or something.

Crazy!
